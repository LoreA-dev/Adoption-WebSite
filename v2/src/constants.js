        description: "<div id=\"contentText\">    <div>        <h1>7 Reasons to Walk Your Dog</h1>        <div>            <p>When your plugged-in, constantly-on-the-go lifestyle has you on the fritz, it feels impossible to                take your dog out for a leisurely stroll. According to a recent study, 33 percent of pet                parents rarely walk their pups. Only half pound the pavement with them each day. While it’s not                always possible to walk your dog for hours at a time, you should be taking a long walk at least a                few times a week.</p>            <p>Can’t commit? Consider hiring a dog walking company to give your pooch a daily dog walk. Many pet                parents who are short on time find a daily dog walking service greatly improves their dog’s                happiness, behavior and well-being. Whether you’re a responsible pet parent or a professional dog                walker who works for a pet care company, here are seven reasons to hit the trail with your favorite                dog:</p>            <h2>#1: Improve Health Manage Weight</h2>            <p>According to the Association for Pet Obesity                Prevention, 56 percent of dogs in the U.S. are overweight or obese. If yours is one of them,                he’s at risk for bladder cancer, skin infections, heart disease, and diabetes. The Department of Family                Consumer Studies,                has found dog owners walk at least four hours per week while non-pet owners squeak in an hour. Dog                walking can lower your weight by five percent and your dog’s by 15 percent. It also improves your                cardiovascular fitness, lowers your blood pressure, and builds your bones. “Mentally, getting                outdoors and having a routine, as well as the release of endorphins from light exercise, reduces                anxiety, depression, and seasonal affective disorder,” says Li-ran Bukovza, founder of Puppy Tip                <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/March-2020_Dog-Walking-2-1024x740.jpg\"                    alt=\"woman walking her dog\">            <h2>#2: Train Your Dog</h2>            <p>Has your dog downed a whole                frozen turkey or started plowing your flower bed? If so, he’s getting rid of pent-up energy.                Walks are the perfect opportunity to curb his bad behavior while practicing obedience commands. “It                is one thing for him to be able to ‘sit’ in the middle of your living room but a whole different                story in a busy park,” says Steffi Trott, founder of SpiritDog Training. “By taking your training on                the road, you’re able to proof commands and teach your dog that anywhere, anytime, can be training                time.”</p>            <p>Trott suggests frequently stopping your dog on walks and giving him obedience commands like “come”                and “watch me”. Consider stopping at street corners. Have him “sit” and then “down”. If he gets up,                use the verbal correction “no” and command him again. Tired of leash tug-of-war? Only let your dog                walk when his leash is loose. Stand still if he pulls and move forward when he comes back to check                on you, letting the leash fall slack or changing direction every time he gets ahead of you.</p>            <h2>#3: Make New Friends</h2>            <p>Dogs can open the door to a new universe of people. “They’re fantastic “social lubricants” — a term                that references anything that makes interacting with other people easier,” says Dr. Jennifer Coates,                who serves on the advisory board for Pup Life Today.“People                are more likely to strike up a conversation with you if you’re out for a walk with your dog rather                than walking on your own or with other people. This can be especially beneficial for those who                suffer from loneliness or depression.”</p>            <p>Dr. Beth Frates is the medical editor of Get Healthy, Get a                Dog, a Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School. When she first adopted her                Goldendoodle named Reesee, she started meeting up with 15 other women and their pooches at a local                dog park. While the dogs honed their social skills, the women talked. Sometimes the relationships                went no further than knowing someone is “Archie’s mom” Other                times they budded into life-long friendships.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dogs-greeting-each-other-1024x690.jpg\"                alt=\"Dogs Meeting Each Other On A Walk In The Park\">            <h2>#4: Strengthen Your Relationship</h2>            <p>“Dogs have changed a lot since they’ve been wolves, but not so much that they don’t still enjoy                traveling with their pack,” Trott says. While he wants you to step up as the alpha, you’ll have to                earn his trust, loyalty, love, and respect. Regular one-on-one time can strengthen and deepen your                bond. If your dog is timid or fearful, daily walks can                give him structure and stability. That level of predictability also can skyrocket his                self-confidence.</p>            <p>Already have an unbreakable bond? Insert some surprise into your dog’s everyday lives. He’ll realize                that they need to stay in tune with you. Instead of walking the same route every day, try new paths                and vary your walk times. Does your dog have a favorite post-workout treat? Let him have a peanut                butter biscuit or turkey                loaf instead. If Saturday is your designated “walk in the park” day, rock your dog’s world                and go on Saturday and Sunday.</p>            <h2>#5: Explore the Environment</h2>            <p>“Even if your pet is unable to walk, there are still benefits to providing outdoor time,” says Beth                Stultz-Hairston, president of Pet Sitters International. “Using a stroller to                take him on a walk engages his senses outside of the home, as he experiences the sights, sounds, and                smells of the outdoors.” Is your dog a drive-by sniffer, eager to inhale as many new scents as                possible? Or does he hunker down and dedicate himself to smelling one location with great intensity?            </p>            <p>Dogs of all ages should enjoy regular sniff walks. “Sniffing instantly lowers your dog’s heart                rate, especially if he tends to be overly excited, reactive, or nervous,” Trott says.</p>            <p>The part of your dog’s brain that’s devoted to exploring smells is 40 times larger than yours. If you                have your dog “heel” for the entire walk or pull him away from every lamppost, it’s like returning a                gripping mystery novel to the library before finding out whodunit.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dog-sniffing-during-dog-walk-1024x683.jpg\"                alt=\"A closeup of a miniature Dachshund sniffing in the grass while owner is walking your dog\">            <h2>#6: Provide a Potty Break</h2>            <p>Dogs normally poop once or twice a day. If your pup is constipated or starts going in the house, try                two short walks. Some dogs move around during bowel movements because it aids in elimination. Potty                breaks aren’t                just about eliminating waste. They’re about communication too. Besides marking their territories,                dogs use urine or feces as calling cards. Dogs’ anal glands give off a musky smell when                they’re scared. So sometimes, poop can alert other dogs of danger. Urine is basically social media                for dogs. Where you might check Twitter for breaking news, dogs want to check the popular pee spots                to discover the sex, age, and health of their followers.</p>            <h2>#7: Make Walking a Habit</h2>            <p>Trott recommends getting a                step counter and setting realistic goals. “In week one, walk your dog for 2,000 steps every                day,” she says. “In week two, walk him for 3,000 steps every day, and so on, until you reach about                6,000 steps.”</p>            <p>Is your dog overweight or                obese? If so, he is at higher risk for joint damage and osteoarthritis. It causes pain,                inflammation, and bone spurs. According to the American Journal of Veterinary Research</a>,                20 percent of middle-aged dogs and 90 percent of seniors have osteoarthritis in one or more joints.            </p>            <p>If your older dog is battling the bulge, try five-minute walks a couple of times per day. “If he                starts panting, limping, or lying down, you’ve overdone it and should dial it back,” Trott says.</p>            <p>Fetch!

        description: "<div id=\"contentText\">    <div>        <h1>Building Bonds and Trusting Relationships with Your Pets</h1>        <div>            <p>There isn’t a relationship around that can survive without trust. My relationship with my dog Peyton                is deep enough that he will trust me most of the time, but there are still those moments when he                looks at me and runs the other way. Often time when pets don’t obey they put themselves in harm’s                way by running in the street or chewing something hazardous. Building bonds with your pet is an                important part of being a good pet parent.</p>            <h2>Ways to Increase Trust</h2>            <p>Peyton and I have been working with a trainer to help us form a deeper bond based on trust. She                explained that there are some other things I need to do beyond the daily walks to earn that trust.                For example, taking him with me on errands or playing fetch, which will help him feel connected to                me and special. I’ve been working hard to take the extra time to be with Peyton and one of our new                favorite things to do are puppy massages!</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dog-massage-1024x684.jpg\"                alt=\"woman giving a dog massage\">            <h2>Give Your Pet a Massage</h2>            <p>I love massages and I know that they release hormones that help humans heal and relax. So I decided                to give Peyton a massage and he loves it just as much as I do! He took a deep sigh and relaxed,                feeling safe and trusting me to care for him while he took a nap.</p>            <h2>Make Your Pet Feel Special</h2>            <p>Another way to help your pet feel special is to make their food more enjoyable. I know that Peyton                loves to eat and he loves it when I put little treats in with his feedings. I spoke with our vet to                see which treats would be safe and healthy and, now I take an extra minute to add some meat, egg, or                broth to his kibble!</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cooking-an-egg-for-dog-food-1024x673.jpg\"                alt=\"cooking an egg for dog food\">            <p>Our pets learn by playing, just like children, so I’ve started playing games with Peyton to engage                both his brain and his body. We started agility classes, have upgraded the ball to a Frisbee,                and I play hide and seek games with his treats. We found some other games for dogs that we are going to                try                soon. I also found these fun games for cats,                because they need just as much playtime as dogs.</p>            <h2>Be Consistent Offer Rewards</h2>            <p>Consistency is very important for animals, so reinforcing all of these activities is key to really                building your bond. I want Peyton to know that he can always expect his walks and his dinner at the                same time. Our trainer’s approach to behavior and attention seeking is that: dogs seek attention and                if they don’t get enough good attention, they will seek bad attention. So you want to set up your                pet to seek good attention and want him to try hard for the praise.</p>            <h2>Enjoy the Bonds of Companionship</h2>            <p>It turns out that my efforts to bond with my pet are rewarded with a lot of benefits. Studies now                show that beyond the obvious cure for loneliness, having the companionship of a pet has proven                medically beneficial. For elderly owners that own pets, there are fewer doctor visits and less                depression. People that are chronically ill find that caring for pets is a motivator to continue to                be engaged in life. In fact, people that have heart attacks are more likely to survive that                important first year if they have a pet. Finally, pets help smooth the effects of the life related                setbacks that happen to everyone. But all of this is depending on you and your pet having a strong                bond.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Dog-loving-companion-1024x683.jpg\"                alt=\"Dog loving companion\">            <p>Peyton already sits at my feet while I work, and climbs on my lap when it’s available. With a bit                more focus from me, Peyton and I will have an even tighter bond. I look forward to him listening to                me all the time and our long, healthy life together!</p>        </div>    </div>",

Sometimes that greeting includes an ear scratch, leg                bump, or a big old dog kiss sweeping across your face! Endearing? Yes. Cute? Yes. Unsanitary?                Definitely.</p>            <p>Animal experts are in agreement on one scientifically proven fact: It is highly unsanitary for your                dog to lick around your face, eyes, and nose! Dogs have been proven to carry various bacteria in                their mouths that can be beneficial or non-effective to their overall health. Most of these bacteria                however, are not meant to be absorbed by the human body through thin membranes such as our eyes,                nose and mouth. Throughout this article, we will explore and outline the reasons why you should not                let your dog kiss your face or other exposed areas such as wounds along with the potential                consequences of having frequent licks from your furry companion.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bigstock-Little-Dog-Licks-Human-Face-M-275887144-1024x683.jpg\"                alt=\"Dog kiss man on nose\">            <h2>Why Do Dogs Kiss to Show Affection?</h2>            <p>According to Cesar Millan, licking behaviors stem from ingrained personality traits bred through                canines as a means of communication, bonding, grooming, or even psychological problems. Mother dogs                show affection to their puppies in a variety of ways to create biological bonds and they use licking                as one tool from the moment of birth. The mother dog will “wake” their puppies from their                post-partum state through licks, use this method to groom puppies and even teach bathroom functions.                They will also feed puppies’ solid food through regurgitation licked by the young until they can                digest it on their own.</p>            <p>Another way kisses or licks is used as a bonding tool is when two dogs meet each other, either for                the first or 1000th time. Dogs will initiate a “feeling out” period and then respond with a tense                posture (when they are mistrusting or wary of each other) or an enthusiastic bark combined with a                lick on either the face or other area of the opposing animal. Dogs also use these displays of                affection to show submission to their pack master or to let them know they are hungry, thirsty, etc.                Domestic house dogs view their owner as their pack master so the ingrained behaviors are                communicated in the same ways.</p>            <p>Dogs who show signs of excessive licking towards humans or objects can also be disguising deeper                mental problems. Such issues could be separation anxiety (the fear of being alone) or being nervous                in their surroundings due to noise, crowds, smells etc.</p>            <h2>Why Not to Kiss?</h2>            <p>Dr. Neilanjan Nandi, has stated that a dog’s mouth is host to “an enormous oral microbiome of                bacteria, viruses and yeast.” The term “zoonotic” is frequently used to describe the bacteria that                reside in your dog’s mouth that is able to be passed on to humans and cause disease.</p>            <p>A dog spends the majority of their time nosing around in areas where they shouldn’t or we wouldn’t                even think to take a healthy sniff! The majority of humans would not nose around another person’s                rear end (feces) or take a whiff/taste of some random garbage left on a sidewalk, or take a                refreshing drink from the toilet bowl (one can assume) but your dog? They definitely would exhibit                one if not all these behaviors. This means that not only is your dog’s mouth a host to these                bacteria but their muzzles can be as well. Additional bacteria are also transferred when your dog                takes a moment to wrap their tongues around their muzzle for a quick cleanup!</p>            <h2>The Dangers of Dog Kisses</h2>            <p>The top five bacteria that could be transferred through the face and/or mouth are outlined in a short                summary below:</p>            <p>1. Capnocytophaga Canimorsus: An organism carried in the mouths of dogs, and it causes a very bad                sepsis infection.<br> 2. Staphylococcus Aureu (Staph Infection): The majority of time your dog can                safely carry this virus strain without it affecting their overall health, but when transferred to a                human it can have life-threatening consequences.<br> 3. Ringworm or Hookworm: Can cause either                painful itchy infections or inflammation, or even intestinal bleeding depending on the point of                entry.<br> 4. E.Coli: A potentially fatal bacterial disease with symptoms ranging from diarrhea to                nausea to intestinal bleeding.<br> 5. Salmonella: A painful bacterial disease that can cause                diarrhea, intestinal cramping, nausea and vomiting.</p>            <h2>Conclusion</h2>            <p>Dog’s are generally affectionate lovable creatures and we would never want to discourage or diminish                that side of their personalities because the feeling of walking in the door and getting a hero’s                greeting is a confidence booster one thoroughly enjoys. Setting boundaries, however, in how our dogs                display that affection can be beneficial for everyone!</p>        </div>    </div>",

        description: "<div id=\"contentText\">    <div>        <h1>Celebrity pet photographer Grace Chon on taking the perfect photo of your pet</h1>        <div>            <p>Doting pet parents have a relentless need to constantly photograph every adorable pet moment.                Their smartphones aren’t filled with selfies and sunsets but rather TONS of photos of their                furbabies… a fluffy coat after getting groomed, Fido laying on his bed, and another of Fido laying                on his bed because this time his paws are crossed… We reached out to celebrity pet photographer and                dog owner herself, Grace Chon, to share with us some of her tips on how to snap a pawesome pet                photo. Here is what she had to say…</p>            <h2>1) Follow the Light</h2>            <p>Always shoot where you get the best light. Usually this ends up being with your dog facing a window,                which I like to call “glamour lighting” because your dog ends up being evenly lit in the front and                the background can drop off into darkness. Natural light is always much more important than                location! If your place is nice and bright, try to keep indoor lights off to avoid having a sickly                yellow color-cast to your images.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GChon1.png\"                alt=\"Grace Chon Pet Photographer\">            <h2>2) Models Like to Eat</h2>            <p>Forget dry dog biscuits – use high reward treats like dehydrated meat snacks or boiled chicken                breast. Always reward positive behavior like sitting still or looking directly into the lens, and                give small morsels to keep the shoot fun and your pup motivated and engaged. Treats are great for                controlling eyeline too – hold it where you’d like your pup to be looking in the shot, and after a                few frames pay your model for his hard work with a tasty bite. If you want your dog to look into the                lens, hold the treat right above the camera lens. If you want him looking above or out of the frame,                hold the treat where his eyes should be.</p>            <h2>3) Make Some Noise</h2>            <p>To get shots of those adorable head tilts and perked up ears, try making some funny sounds to get                your dog’s attention. The trick is to make each sound sparingly and move onto the next one once your                dog grows tired of it because new sounds get old really fast! Other things you can use are whistles,                kazoos, crinkly plastic bags and squeaky toys. You can also try saying your dog’s favorite words.                Some sweet talking might get you some irresistible looks.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GChon2.png\"                alt=\"Grace Chon Pet Photographer\">            <h2>4) Shoot Fast and Furious</h2>            <p>Be sure to take lots and lots of frames. That way you can be sure to capture a shot that’s in focus                and with your dog looking where you want, doing what you want. And when you shoot a lot of frames,                you end up getting images that you never could have thought of shooting. Amazing moments happen in a                fraction of a second!</p>            <h2>5) Change Your View</h2>            <p>Try seeing your dog from a completely different angle. Have them lounge on a chair and photograph                them from below. Try laying down in the grass and shoot up at your dog. If you try to see their                world from a completely different view, you’ll end up with creative and interesting shots that tell                your dog’s story from an unusual perspective.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GChon3.png\"                alt=\"Grace Chon Pet Photographer\">            <h2>6) Use Props</h2>            <p>Add a fun flair to your shots by using toys and other props. Get goofy with things like sunglasses,                wigs, funny hats, and maybe even a heart-shaped helium balloon tied to your dog’s collar. If silly                isn’t your style, you can incorporate more meaningful props like your dog’s favorite toy. Select                props that tell your dog’s story. For example, if your dog likes swimming, try taking a shot with                her in a baby pool wearing an inflatable water ring around her waist. Is he a big couch potato? A TV                remote near his paws might be a fun shot.</p>            <h2>7) A Meaningful Spot</h2>            <p>It’s always extra special if you can shoot in your dog’s favorite location. Maybe this is their                favorite chair, riding shotgun in your car, or at a local park. Not only will she be happy and                relaxed, you’ll capture moments that memorialize her in a place that’s special to you both.</p>            <h2>8) Up Close and Personal</h2>            <p>Don’t forget to take detail shots! Shoot a close up of your dog’s nose, or a close up of their fur.                Take a photo of their paw pads, or the curves of their velvety ears. Remember all the little details                that make up your dog and photograph all the special places you love to kiss and adore. Even shots                of their dog bowls, collars and leashes will someday make a very special memory.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GChon4.png\"                alt=\"Grace Chon Pet Photographer\">            <h2>9) Stage your Shot</h2>            <p>Home staging can make your photos look polished and professional. Be sure to declutter the                background, and bring in props like colorful pillows, a sheepskin rug, or fresh flowers to create a                shot that looks stylish and finished. You can add some extra whimsy by decorating with pennant                banners, paper garlands, confetti and balloons. It always helps to have some color coordination, so                if your dog’s collar or toys can coordinate with the decorations in your home, you’ll look like you                had an art director help you get the shot.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GChon5.png\"                alt=\"Grace Chon Pet Photographer\">            <h2>10) It’s Peanut Butter Time</h2>            <p>If you want to end up with a truly hilarious set of photos, give your dog a small lick of peanut                butter and snap away. You’re guaranteed to get funny photos of your dog’s tongue doing tricks you                never could have imagined. Be sure to start with a small amount so your dog doesn’t get an upset                stomach, and use unsalted peanut butter.</p>        </div>    </div>",

As a pet parent, you can provide a variety of outlets for play either                by playing interactive games or providing suitable toys for your cat to play with alone or with                another pet. Playing with your cat regularly will help you learn about your pet’s personality and                deepen your connection.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cat-Play.jpg\"                alt=\"Cute Cat Playing Upside down\">            <p>Depending on your cat’s age, weight, temperament, and interests, you may be able to set up an area                where your cat can romp around and climb. Cat trees and scratching posts are ideal for this kind of                activity. If you are handy with tools, you can build your own cat jungle gym, or you can find one at                your local pet supply store or online. If your cat is reluctant, you may need to get more involved                in the festivities.</p>            <h2>Try different activities</h2>            <p>Activities that stimulate a cat’s natural hunting instincts are often the best bet. Small motorized                remote controlled and battery powered furry mice are great for getting a cat’s attention. Even the                economical non-motorized mice are appealing; you will just have to do all the mock mouse movements                using a string that is attached to the mouse. Along the same line, feather toys are good bird                replicas. They are often attached to the end of a stick or string so that you can mimic the                movements of a wounded bird, one of a cat’s favorite objects for stalking. Your cat should never                have access to feather toys without supervision. They can be very dangerous if swallowed. And                everyone knows how much kittens love a simple length of yarn. A piece of thick ribbon, shoelace or                yarn can be wiggled across the floor or beneath a closed door (with you on one side of the door and                the cat on the other) just out of the cat’s reach.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cat-Play-with-Feather-Toy-e1578692898233.jpg\"                alt=\"Cat Playing Hide and Seek\">            <p>A lot of cats will grow out of this fascination with string as they age, but not all of them do. It                wouldn’t hurt to try with your older cat. Just remember to put the string and ribbons away after the                games. Many an emergency intestinal blockage could have been avoided if the string had not been left                out for the cat to swallow.</p>            <p>Another favorite is the beam of light. If you already have a smallish flashlight, you can try to get                your cat to chase it around. Laser pointers are even better, since the small beam of light appears                to be a little bug, and cats love to chase bugs. Stay low with the light, or you may have your cat                trying to climb the shelves to catch it and end up with broken knick-knacks on the floor. Also, be                sure to avoid flashing the beam directly into your cat’s eyes.</p>            <h2>Simple things can be fun</h2>            <p>Keep the fun novel for your cat by trying stuff you already have around the house. Empty boxes with                holes cut into them make great “caves” and scratching toys, and crumpled paper, especially the                tissue type that makes lots of noise, is great for batting around. Paper bags are fun for crawling                into, too, but avoid the plastic bags; you don’t want to risk an accidental suffocation. Also:                plastic rings, empty toilet paper and paper towel rolls, stuffed animals, etc. Just be careful none                of the household “toys” can become choking hazards.</p>            <h2>Create areas to explore climb</h2>            <p>Scratching posts and cat trees entice cats to climb, which uses their muscles and naturally wears                down the points of their claws. If you have the space, set up a cat obstacle course in your home so                that your cat can jump from place to place to get to the next perch. There are pre-made shelving                systems that you can find online, or you can build a system of your own, with shelves that go from                the floor to the ceiling in a step pattern. Some people will add a wrap-around ceiling-high shelf so                their cats can climb and jump all the way up to find a good spot where they can watch over their                kitty kingdom. If you have a yard, you can build or buy an outdoor enclosure that allows your cat                the advantage of being outside without the dangers of traffic and other animals.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cat-on-Cat-Tree-Playing-with-Boy.jpg\"                alt=\"Cat on Cat Tree Playing with Boy\">            <p>Finally, if your cat really needs to lose some weight, there are exercise wheels. These are                like those for hamsters but made just for cats! Exercise wheels do not take up much space, and                they allow cats to run and run to their heart’s content.</p>            <h2>How to End a Play Session</h2>            <p>An ideal time to end a play session is after your cat has just scored a decisive “victory,” or if                your cat has lost interest. In both scenarios, give your cat some nice praise just for showing up.            </p>            <h2>Things to remember:</h2>            <ul>                <li>Play for a few short sessions every day</li>                <li>Allow your cat to catch and grab the toy at the end of each game</li>                <li>Provide a variety of toys</li>                <li>At the end of each session, put away toys with string or anything that might present a danger to                    your cat</li>                <li>Never force your cat to play or be trained</li>                <li>Have fun!</li>            </ul>        </div>    </div>",

Let’s explore a few quality options right now, such as:            </p>            <h2>Jogging</h2>            <p>If your dog has a lot of energy and loves action, introduce him to the joys of jogging. For dogs                who’ve never done so before, it may take a little getting used to. But if you start slowly and jog                at the same time each day, your bestie will eventually get the hang of things and you two can enjoy                a great heart healthy daily workout together. For this exercise you may want to try a leash that                fastens to your waist, but ONLY do so if your dog listens well enough to your commands and is not                apt to cause harm or injury by pulling you too hard or too fast!</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-27-at-7.56.09-AM.png\"                alt=\"fun ways to exercise\">            <h2>Swimming</h2>            <p>Breeds like the Irish Setter, the Golden Retriever and the American Water Spaniel love being in                water. If your dog enjoys the wetter side of life, then he’ll probably agree that this is one of the                most fun ways to exercise with you and he’ll want to do it as often as possible!</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-27-at-7.57.50-AM.png\"                alt=\"\">            <h2>Bike Riding</h2>            <p>Dogs who are fit enough to endure a few miles of running will probably love bike riding alongside you                this spring and summer. Like jogging, you may want to try a leash that fastens around your waist and                that leaves your hands free to maneuver your bicycle, but <b><i>only if </i></b>your dog isn’t prone                to pulling and obeys your commands pretty well. We also strongly advise that you only engage in this                form of exercise with your pet on a designated bike path or on a terrain where you’re unlikely to                encounter traffic from other vehicles.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-27-at-7.59.13-AM.png\"                alt=\"fun ways to exercise\">            <h2>Fetch!</h2>            <p>Grab a tennis ball, a frisbee or your dog’s favorite chew toy and head on out for one of the most fun                ways to exercise with your pet. Dogs that like to retrieve items will absolutely love this workout!                For optimal results, make your fetch game challenging and rigorous. Also be sure to engage in this                activity for a predetermined length of time and try to do it at about the same time each day so that                your dog comes to expect it and you both develop a workout routine that sticks!</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-27-at-8.00.35-AM.png\"                alt=\"fun ways to exercise\">            <h2>Walking</h2>            <p>Of course, dog walking is always a                great and fun way to exercise with your dog. Regardless of breed or age, all dogs enjoy at least two                good walks daily! You may walk briskly or at a slower pace, but do walk your dog regularly to help                him burn calories and excess energy (which can often result in undesirable behavior).</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-27-at-8.02.36-AM.png\"                alt=\"fun ways to exercise\">            <h2>Before Exploring Fun Ways to Exercise With Your Dog…</h2>            <p>Depending on your dog’s breed, he may respond to some exercises better than others. We highly                recommend a vet visit before starting a workout routine just to make sure that your little fur buddy                is ready to increase his daily activity. This is especially important for older dogs or those                suffering from arthritis and also for dogs who’ve ever had a broken limb or have even suffered a                recent illness.</p>            <p>Any activity with you is going to be a good time for your pooch, but we do want to advise you to take                it slow at first. If your dog isn’t used to a lot of physical activity, be patient with him while he                adjusts to your new workout regimen. Gradually introduce new exercises to your pet and give him (and                yourself!) time to work up to your optimal workout levels.</p>        </div>    </div>",

Cat adoption is a wonderful way to enrich your life. Thousands of cats and kittens will be looking                for a forever home not only for the month of June, but all year long. Start off on the right foot by                being well-prepared for your furry new arrival by avoiding the rocky adjustment period and getting                right down to the lovin’!</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/girl_with_cat_kisses.jpg\" alt=\"\">            <h2>Make sure everyone in the house is prepared for a new cat.</h2>            <p>When adopting a new cat to join your existing pets, discuss with the adoption facility or your                veterinarian how to make a proper introduction. Cat adoption should be a family affair. The                entire family should plan to visit the shelter or animal control facility.</p>            <h2>Spend time with a few kitties to determine which will be a good fit.</h2>            <p>Ask to take the cat or kitten out of its cage and find an area at the shelter where you can spend                some time with her.Remember that animals in shelters can be nervous around new noises                and smells so be prepared for the cat to take a little while to warm up to you.Although,                some cats are so friendly that they may begin bonding with you the moment they meet                you!Spending time petting and talking to the cat or kitten should give you insight into                its personality to help you decide if it’s a good fit.</p>            <h2>Stock up on supplies before the cat arrives.</h2>            <p>Try to create a “homelike” environment for your new cat right away.You’ll need: a litter                box, litter, food, treats and water bowls, scratching posts, safe and stimulating toys, a cushy bed,                a brush for grooming, a toothbrush, and nail clippers. Don’t rush into cat adoption but take the                time to plan and have everything you need on hand. It is best to have your shopping done prior                to bringing your new cat home.</p>            <h2>Kitten-proof your home.</h2>            <p>Kittens can get tangled or choked by anything swinging or hanging.Keep your new pet safe                by securely anchoring drape or blind cords out of reach. To prevent chewing on electric and phone                cords, bundle them with a cord manager and fasten away from kittens’ reach.Rubber bands,                jewelry, Christmas decorations, balloons and other small items are dangerous to kittens that may                swallow them.Remove poisonous plants and roach or ant traps and make sure the toilet lid                is down.Keep kitchen and bathroom cabinets closed so your kitten doesn’t encounter                bleach, detergent, dental floss and other household items when exploring.In the laundry                area, keep washer and dryer doors closed: A kitten may climb into a warm dryer for a                nap.Remember, if something would be harmful for a toddler, it’s potentially harmful for                your kitten.</p>            <h2>See a vet ASAP.</h2>            <p>Kittens seem indestructible, but can get sick easily. A vet’s early diagnosis improves the                chances of a speedy recovery. Screening tests, preventive care, vaccinations, flea                prevention and worm medications, save lives and ensure that your kitten grows to healthy adulthood.            </p>            <h2>Slowly introduce to other family members.</h2>            <p>Everyone in the family will be eager to get to know the new cat but she may not be ready to have                several unfamiliar people crowded in her sanctuary room (a room you designate as her safe zone                before letting her free into the rest of the house). Do individual introductions slowly and                see how she responds. If she’s hiding and seems nervous, back off and let her gain confidence                in her new surroundings. There will be plenty of time later to make formal introductions.</p>            <p><em>Have you recently introduced a newly adopted cat or kitten into your                    home? Tell us about it</em></p>        </div>    </div>",

With                vacations to plan and exercise routines to maintain there are lots of reasons to hire a pet sitter over                the                summer.</p>            <h2>A Pet Sitter Makes Taking a Vacation Less Stressful</h2>            <p>There are lots of amazing places to see and experience, but not all of them allow pets. Even if a pet is                allowed, it can be stressful and dangerous for animals to travel. Hiring a professional pet care                provider                can make sure your pet is taken care of while you take some time to go on adventures.</p>            <h2>A Pet Sitter Helps You Maintain Your Pet’s Routine</h2>            <p>It can be hard to keep an animal on an exercise routine or specialized diet. Sometimes just giving                yourself a                break can help you to relax, refocus or even sleep in. One of the best reasons to try out a pet sitter.            </p>            <p>                <img                    src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pet-Care-Provider-and-Cat_132246905.jpg\">            <h2>A Pet Sitter Makes it Easier for Your Family</h2>            <p>Hiring someone can take the pressure off of asking friends and family to watch the pets while you are                gone.                It saves you an awkward conversation and saves them any potential embarrassment. Also, if they don’t                know a                lot about pets it can be stressful for everyone, pet included.</p>            <h2>A Pet Sitter Allows You to Spend Time with the Family</h2>            <p>Probably the most obvious reason to hire someone to care for your pet is to give the rest of the family                some                time. Pets are great members of the family, but sometimes you need to take time off and make sure                everyone                is feeling the love. A dedicated pet care provider will free up your schedule to make the most of your                time                with the kids.            </p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_1822-1024x683.jpg\">            <h2>A Pet Sitter Provides Peace of Mind</h2>            <p>A professional pet care provider knows what they are doing. They watch our little buddies for a living. A                professional will always have your pet’s best interests at heart so you can relax.</p>            <h2>A Pet Sitter Promotes Good Health</h2>            <p>Not only will a professional pet care provider make sure your pet is following their routines they also                can                keep an eye on their health. They will keep your pet away from strange animals, and you don’t have the                stress from leaving them in a kennel.</p>            <img                src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bigstock-Golden-retriever-dog-and-man-118372430.jpg\">            <h2>A Pet Sitter is Better for Your Pet’s Mood</h2>            <p>Your pets will miss you too, but a pet sitter will take time to play with them and make them feel loved                even                with you away.</p>            <h2>A Pet Sitter Allows Your Pet to Be Comfortable</h2>            <p>Your pet will be able to stay at home in their bed while you are gone. Your pet will miss you soon                enough,                but at least they will have their toys and bed for comfort.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_1823-1024x768.jpg\">            <h2>A Pet Sitter Helps You Balance Work Life</h2>            <p>Summers are not always all fun and games. Sometimes responsibilities will keep you away more than you’d                like.                Pet sitters can significantly help by walking and playing with your pets to let you have more time.</p>            <h2>A Pet Sitter Makes Life Easy</h2>            <p>Maybe the best reason to hire a pet sitter it that it is just so accessible and useful. Going back is                hard!                You just set up a schedule, and that’s it. No karting pets around. No hassling over who knows what about                this or that pet. Just give them a schedule and head out, easy as that!</p>        </div>    </div>",

        description: "<div id=\"contentText\">    <div>        <h1>Dog-Friendly Day Trips for the Summer Months</h1>        <div>            <p>When deciding on a day trip with your                dog, it’s important to keep in mind that it’s still summer, so keeping your dog cool and hydrated is                still                priority number one. There are many summer activities that you may not think of as completely                dog-friendly, but are likely                in                your local area. Most dogs love the same activities as their owners, and there are easy ways to keep                these                activities safe for our canine companions. Safety is the main priority when planning your summer pet                activities. Once you’ve got a plan, an outing with your pet can be an amazingly rewarding experience.            </p>            <h2>Hiking with Your Dog in the Summer</h2>            <p>Dog hikes are fun for both                humans                and dogs alike. The first thing you have to do when planning a hike for you and your pet is research the                trails. It’s crucial that you check ahead to see if the trail you plan to hike allows dogs. Many                National                Parks don’t allow dogs and, although this is unfortunate for us pet owners, there are plenty of other                options for you and your four-legged friend. Make sure the trail isn’t too arduous for your pet, and                bring                enough water to keep both you and your pet well hydrated. Also, don’t forget to bring poop bags for the                inevitable poop scooping on                the                trail. Getting your dog                walking                and active is essential for an active lifestyle, and going on a hike is a great way to do this.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bigstock-Man-Bending-Down-To-Pet-His-Bl-106314506.jpg\"                alt=\"Summer hike with dog\">            <h2>Going to the Beach with Your Dog in the Summer</h2>            <p>Beaches can also be a fun summer activity for you and your pet. As with the hikes, make sure dogs are                allowed                on the beach you plan to visit, and pack plenty of water. Many beaches have a pet-friendly water spigot                accessible, so scout around and find that water source. After taking care of the water situation, try to                find a spot of shade on the beach or bring an umbrella. You don’t want your dog overheating on those                hotter                days. Also, if your dog goes into the water make sure you keep an eye on them. Rising tides can bring                large                waves and strong currents that may catch you or your pet off guard.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bigstock-Young-Woman-Walking-With-Dog-120735410_cropped-1024x700.jpg\"                alt=\"Woman on beach with dog\">            <h2>Participating in Summer Charity Events</h2>            <p>Another great summer activity is to sign up for a dog-friendly running or                walking                event, preferably for a beneficial pet charity. Participating in one of these events is a great                experience                for both you and your dog. It allows a kind of connection with your animal and other pets and their                owners                that many other activities do not. It’s a great excuse to get you and your pet in shape, and a great                memory                for both of you.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bigstock-Dog-And-Owner-Walking-92918369-1024x683.jpg\"                alt=\"Dog walk\">            <h2>Keeping Active Each Day of Summer</h2>            <p>Getting away once and awhile and doing something special is nice, but keeping your dog active each day is                even more important. Daily dog                walks are critical to a dog’s well-being. Most dogs require two to three walks a day in order to                stay fit and happy. If you are too busy, consider using a pet-sitting or dog walking                service. Although this may seem like an obvious activity, it’s important to keep your dog                active when you are away. Even a simple neighborhood dog                walk                can be very beneficial to your pet.</p>        </div>    </div>",

To ensure you find the perfect pet sitter, you should conduct an interview, check references and                make                sure the sitter is licensed, bonded and insured, and LOVES pets. But there are some additional                steps                you should also take to help ensure your pet will receive the best care possible:<img                    src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bigstock-152145332.jpg\"                    alt=\"Pet sitter with dog\"></p>            <h2>Schedule Early</h2>            <p>Most pet sitters book appointments far in advance. Make reservations as early as possible to guarantee a                spot                for your pet’s care. If your schedule changes, alert your pet sitter so additional care can be scheduled                if                necessary.</p>            <h2>Meet; Greet</h2>            <p>Make sure your pet has had an opportunity to meet the sitter before your vacation. Give your sitter your                pet                schedule, feeding and medication instructions. If possible, have the sitter take your dog for a                walk                so that your pet and sitter get accustomed to each other, or bond for a few minutes with you cat or                other                pets.</p>            <h2>Pet Care Information and Supplies</h2>            <p>Don’t make your sitter search for pet care items. Place everything your sitter will need in one specific                place. This includes food; treats (including a can opener, utensil to mix/chop food and scoop for                measuring dry fare), extra food and consumable supplies just in case, medications (with clearly written                instructions), leash and collar/harness, paper towels and cleaning supplies, broom/dust pan or vacuum                cleaner, plastic bags for waste disposal, litter and scooper, and potty pads if used. Clearly write out                and                review with your pet sitter any special instructions you want them to perform.</p>            <h2>Thermostat</h2>            <p>Your pet will be in your locked, sealed home. Make sure the thermostat is set at a comfortable                temperature                for your pet. Leave instructions on how to adjust the temperature range for your thermostat in case of a                power-outage.</p>            <h2>Pet Proof Your Home</h2>            <p>Pets can be more inquisitive and bored when they are left alone and get into mischief. Put toilet lids                down,                close cupboards and closets, store medications, perfumes, loose small objects and household cleansers                away                and out of your pet’s reach.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bigstock-124960364.jpg\"                alt=\"Cat playing with toilet paper\">            <h2>Alarms, Off-limit Areas, Home Access</h2>            <p>Are there areas where your pet is not allowed? Make sure you close off the rooms and let the sitter know                that                those areas are to be kept off limits. Close and lock doors, including garage, and patio doors and                windows                before you leave. Use timers to control indoor lights so your pet’s day/night schedule is similar to                when                you are at home. Check to make sure gates and fences are closed and locked.</p>            <h2>Visitor List</h2>            <p>If you live in an apartment or gated community, advise and authorize security that your pet sitter will                be                visiting and, if appropriate, let you neighbors know too. Also, if you plan to have friends, family or                someone else also checking on your house and pets in your absence, let the sitter know.  Clearly                explain what the pet sitter is responsible for and what the other visitors will be doing to avoid                confusion.                Also let the sitter know about gardeners, pool or house maintenance providers who might also be on the                premises in your absence.</p>            <h2>In Case of Emergency</h2>            <p>Your pet sitter should have the information about where to take your pet in case of a health emergency.                You                should also notify your veterinarian in writing that a sitter will be watching your pet and authorize                the                veterinarian to provide medical care during your absence if necessary. If there is a natural disaster                and                your sitter needs to remove your pet from your premises, have a pet emergency kit available and a pet                carrier too. You should also communicate with your sitter how you would like to get updates about                your                pet, via text, email or phone.</p>            <img src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bigstock-Dog-Telephone-Phone-83750801.jpg\"                alt=\"Dog Making Emergency Phone Call \">            <h2>Prepare Your Pet Sitter</h2>            <p>Preparation is the key to make sure your pet sitter has all of the information they need to properly care                for                your pet while you are away.

You’ve chosen a great location, booked yourself in the swankiest            hotel you could find and you’re counting down the days before you get to let loose and enjoy some            well-deserved fun.

You love your little cuddle buddy so much and wish you had the option of taking her            with you, but you can’t. Should you choose in home pet care or should you send your precious companion at a            nearby kennel or boarding facility? What should you do? Which option is ideal for your best friend?</p><img            src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bigstock-Small-dog-maltese-sitting-in-t-126841607-1024x684.jpg\"            alt=\"White dog in packed suit case\" >        <h2>A Straight Answer</h2>        <p> At-home pet care is a better solution for your pet than a kennel or boarding facility.            This is almost always true for cats and dogs, as well as other pets such as birds and reptiles. While            boarding is often used, at-home pet care has emerged as a better solution since it allows your beloved to            remain in the familiar environment she is most used to and in a place where she feels comfortable and is            safest.</p>        <p>Before you decide, let’s look at some of the pros and cons of both options:</p>        <h2>The Pros of At-Home Pet Care:</h2>        <ul>            <li>Staying at home keeps your pet comfortable</li>            <li>Maintaining a normal routine helps relieve anxiety while you are away</li>            <li>Being in a safe and secure environment keeps your pet at ease</li>            <li>Focused attention from their Pet Care Provider while playing and exercising reminds them they are loved                and cared for</li>        </ul>        <img            src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bigstock-Sleeping-young-man-with-fluffy-118119101_cropped.jpg\"            alt=\"Perrito bonito\">        <h2>The Cons of At-Home Pet Care</h2>        <ul>            <li>Your pet may miss you</li>            <li>Prices may be a bit higher</li>        </ul>        <p>As you can see, the pros outweigh the cons here. And if you bring on the right dog walker or pet sitter, your            pet may not even miss you! If you have security cameras in your home or a pet sitter who is willing to video            chat with you, you can even peek in and even say hello to your love bug every day that you are away.</p>        <h2>The Pros of Pet Boarding</h2>        <ul>            <li>Daily costs may be lower</li>            <li>Your dog might enjoy making new friends at a boarding facility</li>        </ul>        <h2>The Cons of Pet Boarding</h2>        <ul>            <li>Adjusting to a new environment, scents, sights and sounds which may be frightening to them</li>            <li>Exposure to airborne diseases, such as kennel cough and canine influenza</li>            <li>Possibility that your dog may be picked on by an alpha dog, possibly causing physical or psychological                harm and high vet bills</li>            <li>Lack of attention or quality of environment they are used to</li>            <li>Increased stress or anxiety from a bad boarding experience</li>            <li>Desire to escape from the new environment may cause your pet to run away and become lost</li>        </ul>        <h2>Weighing Your Options</h2>        <p dir=\"ltr\">So, on the one hand, you have a scenario where, besides missing you, not much changes in your pet’s            life. On the other hand, with boarding, there are more than a few serious risks involved. Being creatures of            habit and pretty big on having a territory of their own, most pets will appreciate staying at home without            you as opposed to going to a strange environment <em dir=\"ltr\">without you</em>.</p>            <img            src=\"https://www.fetchpetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bigstock-Owner-And-Labrador-Retriever-D-93303248.jpg\"            alt=\"Dog walker and happy dog\">        <h2>Our Full Disclosure</h2>        <p>Clearly, we have a bit of a bias here, but it’s not just because we offer superior pet sitting and dog            walking services. We started Fetch! Pet Care because we honestly believe that there’s no place like home for            pets and we want them to feel as happy, safe and comfortable as possible. There simply is no better way to            care for your pet when you have to hit the road!</p>        <h2>The Stress-Free Option</h2>        <p>Your pet has as much difficulty as you do when you are away. There is a distinct difference between leaving            her at a strange place and leaving her at home, however. As leaving her at home creates less stress and            supports her comfort, we hope that you will agree that at-home pet care is always better than boarding.</p>    </div></div>"
